# M220J: MongoDB for Java Developers

This repository is where I store source code and documentation used during the course [M220J - MongoDB for Java Developers](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M220J/about).

This README file and all that exist under `tickets` directory are copied from [Carlan's repo](https://github.com/carlan/m220j/) who did a good work migrating them.

You can check the work performed in each ticket in the corresponding branch:

## What You'll Learn

This course will teach you how to use MongoDB as the database for a Java application.

You'll play the role of a back-end developer for a Java application, and your job is to implement the application's communication with MongoDB. This includes:

- Reading and writing data
- Using the Aggregation Framework
- Managing the configuration of the database client through the Java driver
- Creating a robust application by handling exceptions and timeouts

**Prerequisites:**
We highly recommend taking M001 prior to taking this course. A basic understanding of **MongoDB's document model** as well as familiarity with **Java development environments** will help you get the most out of this course.

## What You'll Build

You'll build the back-end for a movie-browsing application called MFlix.

Using the MongoDB Java Driver, you will implement MFlix's basic functionality. This includes basic and complex movie searches, registering new users, and posting comments on the site.

You will also add more features to the MFlix application. This includes writing analytical reports, increasing the durability of MFlix's connection with MongoDB, and implementing security best practices.
